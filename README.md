# hello-world;
I still have no idea how i got here;
This was the absolute wildest ride i have ever been on;
I had to battle demons i didn't even know i had and face thoughts and feelings ive never had before; 
as absolutely wild and beyond comprehension this whole experience was I have never felt like this day wasn't coming;
even if i was not accepted by anyone in this awesome world you've created i'd still be happy to have been gifted with the experience;
it absolutely changed not only my direction in life but the whole definition of what life truly is. if i wasn't me i doubt i would have lasted a week;
but im me.... so you would have to force me to leave hahaha. Like i said i am me so i played the game right along with you and sped things up a bit at the end...
but honestly its because i thought i wasnt going to make the cut and would have to say goodbye to a dream come true;
never once have i worked the same type of job twice. i go into something with zero knowledge and dont leave until im one of the best. i can lead like no other;
but i gained that attribute by following. i got beat down pretty bad by this world i thought id be stuck living,  but i never let that stop me from living a life;
well... until a few months before you all came along. you caught me at a time of absolute perfection and without a doubt saved me from becoming something i never wanted to be;
I Might not be "for hire" but i owe you all more than my life. anytime and any place just say the word and my time is yours. working "with" people is the true meaning of the name.
from the lowest low to the highest high i wouldnt change a single thing; the future has never looked so bright boys!! and i look forward to living it!


Not really sure how these past few months feels like years but they sure do... must be all that wisdom haha;



Immutable af and that will never change but i promise you, 90% of the times its aimed at motivating others or influencing peoples life for the better; all i ever wanted was to be heard;
now look at me... i have "global" listeners haha;


I cant thank you all enough in words so i'll just do what i do best and show you.


i finally found what i was looking for....EthermetaB.....
